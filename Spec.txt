Currently create_other_server in file.rs works like this
Server accepts tcp connection and needs to immedietly be sent a rsa public key in the following format:
big_n,big_e
encoded using biguint.tostring() on the n and the e
Then the server will encrypt a secret and send it back down the socket as Biguint.to_le_bytes()
and expect the decrypted answer

Then the connection will either be dropped or verified,

verified will accept connections of the form 
big_n,big_e-[MESSAGE]

where big_n,big_e is the public key of the reciepient
